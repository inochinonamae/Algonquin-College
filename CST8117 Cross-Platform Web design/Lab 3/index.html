                        care services during normal business hours (weekdays
                        9AM to 5PM). If your cat is lonely at home while
                        you are working at the office. If your cat is
                        annoying you while you try to work from home.
                        Dropping off your cat at Fluffy Friends is a
                        great solution! Our caretakers are experienced
                        cat owners who will feed, pet, and play with
                        your cat throughout the day. Your cat will
                        develop lifelong friendships with the other
                        cats at our daycare. We also have a total of 42
                        cat trees in our tiny location! Great places for
                        your cat to sleep and scratch their day away. </p>
